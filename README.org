SuperCollider app to support experiments with intonation in performance of Gy√∂rgi Ligeti's Hora Lunga for solo Viola.  Part of the PhD Thesis of Eleftheria Togia at TMS of IU. 

* Instructions

** Installation

1. Download the library and unzip it.
2. Drag the library folder to your SuperCollider extensions folder.  Note: The Extensions folder should be inside your SuperCollider UserAppSupportDir.  To open the UserAppSupportDir from your SuperCollider Application, choose Menu =File=, submenu =Open user support directory=.  If that directory does not contain a directory called =Extensions=, then you should create such a directory inside it.
3. Start SuperCollider, or recompile the supercollider library.

** Background

Pitches to monitor and to support for intonation:

** Usage

To start tenutas for practicing, evaluate this in a SuperCollider workspace: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
HoraLunga.tenutas
#+END_SRC

To start resonances for practicing, evaluate this in SuperCollider workspace:

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
HoraLunga.resonance
#+END_SRC
